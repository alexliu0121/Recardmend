# NUK_project_Recardmend
In recent years, the use of credit cards as a medium of exchange has become increasingly popular. Considering the fact that people holding multiple credit cards canâ€˜t absorb such a large amount of credit card reward in a short period of time, we have developed a system that **recommends credit card reward according to the needs of users**.
## Illustrate
Users can **add the credit cards** they have and **select the locations** where they want to make purchases. In this way, the system will **list the credit card reward** based on the cards they have when they make purchases at the location.
Users can also **edit the credit cards** they have and **pin the certain cards or rewards** they are interested to get **push notifications**.
The APP also has a **calendar function** for the uses to **add the certain rewards as an event to the calendar**. Therefore, the users wouldn't miss the rewards they want to use.
## Responsible
We are a team of four people, and I am mainly responsible for **building APP interface using Flutter and Android Studio**, **Connecting front-end and back-end**, and then **pre-processing the data and database management using Firebase database**.
## Run the project
run the project according to the following instructions:
```

```
